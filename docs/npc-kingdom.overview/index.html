Individual cities are able to pick representative however they feel.\nLocations Capital City: Caladan Secondary Cities: Acadia Bellfort People Four Important Figures: Duke Leto Atreides Duchess Jessica Atreides Master at Arms Gurney Halleck Leader of the military forces of the Duchy. While these forces are small, Halleck is an well known and respected warrior and likewise the quality of the Atreides infantry is very high. Mentat Thufir Hawat The Mentat title is a very important one within the Atreides Duchy, reversed for a trusted advisor with a truly formidable breadth of knowledge. Hawat uses a spacial meditative state to strength his mental abilities. Four Common Names: Molly Thomas Robert Katherine Naming Guidelines: British English Commune of Atrxous Most of the other governments have centralized power structure, but not the Commune of Atrxous. This government is communism, enforced via a magic contract called The Atrxous. Once you sign the contract, you agree to share all of your wealth, shed your social status and live for the betterment of the Commune. Violating the contract is impossible, enforced via enchantment magic and the transmutation of the valuable to the worthless.\nGovernment Structure Formally speaking, there is no structure to the government since there is effectively no government. Generally there is no need for one either since the Atrxous prevents crimes from being committed against others who have signed it.\nLocations Capital City: (If they formally had one) Atrxous - Hardly more than a hamlet, Atrxous holds the contract in the only fully stone building in the Commune People Important NPCs: Forum Delegate Brigita Červinkov Forum Delegate Leopold Kadlec 4 Common Names: Ludvik Kristian Saskie Dagmar Language of Inspiration: Longer names, often with harsh consonant sounds. Similar to Czech. Niven Imperium The Niven Imperium is undoubted a force to be reckoned with, if they ever wanted to. This government is relatively isolationist and stagnant. That last major reform was implemented over 200 years ago. While the three major cities are decadent and bustling, the status of the villages and farmers is relatively unknown. The Imperium is also known to be the only government with several settlements on the outer flanks of the boundary ridge of the Basin.\nGovernment Structure The Imperium is ruled by an Emperor, who has absolute power but rarely uses it. Most of the daily administration of the Imperium is facilitated between military leader, the Shogun and the primary advisor to the Emperor, who uses the title of Adobaizā.\nPlaces Capital City: Daitoshi - An absolutely massive city rife with vice and violence under the less than watchful personal guard of the Emperor. Secondary Cities: Machi - Smaller and located deep in the mountains, Machi started as a research station working with rare mountain ores but has since grown into a large alpine city. It is still home to the Machi Laboratories, a renowned research facility that seems to be in decline, overtaken by newer facilities in other kingdoms. Mura - Smaller than even Machi, Mura is the agricultural hub of the empire, where farmers come from the fertile plains below the mountains to sell goods up the main trade route to Daitoshi and Machi. People Four Important NPCs: Shogun Ichika, the Dragon Slayer Ichika is a brilliant strategist, and one of the most respected generals in the Great Basin, famous for her single handed take down of a black dragon hunting travelers in a mountain pass now know as the Tail of the Dragon that left her without a left arm or left eye. Emperor Yuusei Whatever Yuusei wants he shall receive, and as a result he wants for nothing. He few obligations include being the formal head of state of the Imperium, so he travels to other governments when needed. Diamyo Riku A Diamyo is a regional warlord and Riku is the warlord of Machi. His forces are thus well equipped and the most fearsome constituent of the military forces of the Imperium. Adobaizā Aoi The Adobaizā is the personal advisor of to the Emperor, and since she administers the daily operation of the empire, Aoi wields considerable internal power. Four Common Names: Mio Koharu Souta Haru Language of Inspiration: Japanese Principality of Vi One of the notable things to be aware of with the Principality is that while the Princess has the most power on paper, the people of the principality are very deeply religious, so much political power also resides in the Church and the Highpriest. Most “laws” within the principality are actually Holy Mandates from the church. The current highpriest, Orden Wur, has been leaning a crack down on arcane magic since he came to power 32 years ago. The Church also enforces its Mandates, leaving the formal government primarily dealing with other government and managing the relation between the Principality and the Koncord.\nLocations Capital City: Cerca - A fortress city on the shore of the Carter Lake, home to the Princess’s Palace and the Central Cathedral. Secondary City: Vurki - The economic center of the Principality, as the Church dictates a separation between the divine and the mundane of the economy. People Four Important NPCs: Highpriest Orden Wur Viven Vi (daughter of the Princess) Princess Luria Vi Liaison to the Church, Mu Sarka The offical bridge between the Princess and the Highpriest. Four Common Names: Bur Juska Stef Ami Language Tools: Names should be short with long vowel sounds. See the Jamaican Names fantasy name generator.
