What we do know is that all of the oracles, augurs and sibyls of this land started receiving constant visions of death and calamity on a scale that they'd never seen. Years pasted, and the star grew brighter and brighter in the night sky, now called Xylte, Destroyer of Worlds promised doom to all that lived below.\nA band of heroes then rose with a plan to save the land from certain destruction.\nKieros, Herald of Divinity Gralf, Herald of Courage Azeem, Herald of Foresight Izuka, Herald of Knowledge Rimev, Herald of Happiness Xul, Herald of Stealth It was only through their work that civilization survived the impact of Xylte, an event now known as the Shattering. While we don't know how they did it, what we do know is that afterwards the heart of the Star of Death was suspended over a newly formed basin.\nThese events occurred 1763 years ago. For the next several hundred years, records are incomplete and little is known.\nThe Basin Today The Great Basin as it has become is currently divided into ten kingdoms with a boundary ring of mountains and large lake in the center, Kratermeer.\nArendelle A mostly human kingdom with a well above average rate of elemental humans born within it's border.\nGovernment Structure A traditional monarchy.\nLocations Capital City: Arendelle People Forum Delegates: Murtagh Freya Task Force Members: Dr. Luna (Former) Atreides Duchy Yep. This is shamelessly stolen from Dune. To be fair, I picked that specific book before I realized how many of you have read the book. The largest difference between the people in the book and the people here is that Paul was never born.\nThe Atreides Duchy is located in the northwest of the Great Basin, directly above the Principality of Vi. The government of the Duchy is centered around the Duke and Duchess, currently Leto and Jessica Atreides. There capital city of Caladan is not opulent like some other capital cities, but it is very welcoming. That describes the Atreides people well, not the wealthiest, but very generous and sharing with others. They are one of the first to offer assistance to other kingdoms and because of this are generally well liked by the other members of the Koncord.\nGovernment Structure The title of Duke is hereditary, pasted from parents to the eldest child through the generations. The Duke and Duchess serve as the executive seat of power, directing the military and negotiating with the other kingdoms. Laws are enforced by the Duke and Duchess but passed by the Landsraad, a legislature consisting of representatives from towns and cities of the Duchy with a set number of representatives per population bracket. Individual cities are able to pick representative however they feel.\nLocations Capital City: Caladan Secondary Cities: Acadia Bellfort People Four Important Figures: Duke Leto Atreides Duchess Jessica Atreides Master at Arms Gurney Halleck Leader of the military forces of the Duchy. While these forces are small, Halleck is an well known and respected warrior and likewise the quality of the Atreides infantry is very high. Mentat Thufir Hawat The Mentat title is a very important one within the Atreides Duchy, reversed for a trusted advisor with a truly formidable breadth of knowledge. Hawat uses a spacial meditative state to strength his mental abilities. Forum Delegates: Lord Andrew Cantort Lady Elizabeth Cantort Four Common Names: Molly Thomas Robert Katherine Naming Guidelines: British English Commune of Atrxous Most of the other governments have centralized power structure, but not the Commune of Atrxous. This government is communism, enforced via a magic contract called The Atrxous. Once you sign the contract, you agree to share all of your wealth, shed your social status and live for the betterment of the Commune. Violating the contract is impossible, enforced via enchantment magic and the transmutation of the valuable to the worthless.\nGovernment Structure Formally speaking, there is no structure to the government since there is effectively no government. Generally there is no need for one either since the Atrxous prevents crimes from being committed against others who have signed it.\nLocations Capital City: (If they formally had one) Atrxous - Hardly more than a hamlet, Atrxous holds the contract in the only fully stone building in the Commune People Important NPCs: Forum Delegate Brigita Červinkov Forum Delegate Leopold Kadlec 4 Common Names: Ludvik Kristian Saskie Dagmar Language of Inspiration: Longer names, often with harsh consonant sounds. Similar to Czech. Eichen Kingdom Editor's Note: Ah, yes, how can anybody forget the fascist, German squirrels?\nThe land of the Eichen is the land of their forests. Populated nearly exclusively by shape-changing anthropomorphic squirrels (A re-flavored kitsune), the Eichen Kingdom is a militarist place with a… strong sense of community. There is also a strong worship of Grosse Eichornchen, the squirrel god.\nGovernment Structure Unlike most monarchies where the title is passed down by blood, the title of King or Queen in the Eichen Kingdom is determined by a series of challenges including sparring (unarmed and armed), survival tests and quizzes about the history of the Kingdom and military tactics. After the challenges, the populous votes in a ranked-choice election.\nOnce elected, the monarch rules for life and near-complete control over all aspects of Eichen government, military and economy (which are all basically the same thing).\nLocations Capital City: Whichever city the monarch's house is in. People Important NPCs: King Romstein General Maximilian Reverend Velecia Forum Delegates: Marchi Elenek Barno Henchor Task Force Members: Zorro Empire of Xylte A territorial and xenophobic empire, one of the few which has actually conquered land after the founding of the Koncord. The Empire started as Republic before a series of increasingly brutal civil wars caused the Republic of Xylte to condense and centralize power into a Consul who then overthrew the Senate and declared an Empire.\nGovernment Structure The Imperial Cult of Xylte recognizes the Emperor, his wife and first born son as divinely sanctioned to rule the Empire. The Emperor has absolute power over other the government, the people, their religion and most importantly the military.\nLocation Capital City: Maestri Ændor\nOne of the most notable events in recent history was the conquering of Ændor in 1623. A small satellite nation of elves on the western border of the Empire. After years of aggressive behavior, when Ændor's King died it was the perfect time for Xylte to take over. After stripping Ændor of its legal protection, the army of Xylte invaded, burning the small nation nearly to the ground. Many military strategists believe that the only reason that the Ændorran elves weren't completely massacred was the presence of troops from the Ecihen Kingdom.\nPeople\nTask Force Members: Oisin People Important NPCs: Emperor Falto Tatius Imperial Legate Brutus Halburn Forum Delegates: Silvius Albina Janus Brutus Kingdom of Galimatias A progressive kingdom with a issue with undead, Galimatias is the economic hub of the basin, rich in materials from the most mountainous parts of the boundary ring and fertile fields. Cultural festivals are a cornerstone of the Galimatian year, with three major festivals celebrating birth, death and the renewal of the year.\nGovernment Structure The government is controlled by a King and Queen, a title passed down by blood, who rule with a divine mandate from the two primary deities of the land, Perun the God of Guidance and Mokosz the Goddess of Earth. While the Church also holds considerable political power, the monarchy is firming in control of both domestic and foreign policy.\nLocations Galimatias is divided into several districts\nJeden - Farming district Dwa - Fishing district Piec - Research district Siedem - Business district Osiem - Mining district People Important NPCs: Queen Tekli Shadowmend King Bennett James Prince Valintin Forum Delegates: Jacob Nowak Lilka Moonriver Task Force Members: Breagan Kingdom of Trobreryn A mercantile kingdom and the shipping hub of the Basin. Although each nation has a territorial boundary waters extending into Kratermeer, the majority of the lake is ruled as territorial waters of Trobreryn, allowing them to control most of the boat traffic on the lake.\nGovernment Structure Formally the Kingdom of Trobreryn is a monarchy, ruled by the Rosach family. However, a guild system also exists which regulates the lucrative trade economy. The monthly formal meeting between the monarch and the guild leaders is called the Guildmaster Gathering.\nNotable guilds include:\nMerchant Guild Mage Guild Bard Guild Farmer Guild Builder Guild Medical Guild Non-denominational Clerics Guild Locations Capital City: Taerwyn People Important NPCs: King Miall Rosach Captain of the Guard Nessa Preston Merchant Guidlmaster Foalan Ragnory Forum Delegates: Hand of the King Videla Parre Hand of the Guilds Peric Abell Task Force Members: Wil Ragnory Niven Imperium The Niven Imperium is undoubted a force to be reckoned with, if they ever wanted to. This government is relatively isolationist and stagnant. That last major reform was implemented over 200 years ago. While the three major cities are decadent and bustling, the status of the villages and farmers is relatively unknown. The Imperium is also known to be the only government with several settlements on the outer flanks of the boundary ridge of the Basin.\nGovernment Structure The Imperium is ruled by an Emperor, who has absolute power but rarely uses it. Most of the daily administration of the Imperium is facilitated between military leader, the Shogun and the primary advisor to the Emperor, who uses the title of Adobaizā.\nPlaces Capital City: Daitoshi - An absolutely massive city rife with vice and violence under the less than watchful personal guard of the Emperor. Secondary Cities: Machi - Smaller and located deep in the mountains, Machi started as a research station working with rare mountain ores but has since grown into a large alpine city. It is still home to the Machi Laboratories, a renowned research facility that seems to be in decline, overtaken by newer facilities in other kingdoms. Mura - Smaller than even Machi, Mura is the agricultural hub of the empire, where farmers come from the fertile plains below the mountains to sell goods up the main trade route to Daitoshi and Machi. People Four Important NPCs: Shogun Ichika, the Dragon Slayer Ichika is a brilliant strategist, and one of the most respected generals in the Great Basin, famous for her single handed take down of a black dragon hunting travelers in a mountain pass now know as the Tail of the Dragon that left her without a left arm or left eye. Emperor Yuusei Whatever Yuusei wants he shall receive, and as a result he wants for nothing. He few obligations include being the formal head of state of the Imperium, so he travels to other governments when needed. Daimyo Riku A Diamyo is a regional warlord and Riku is the warlord of Machi. His forces are thus well equipped and the most fearsome constituent of the military forces of the Imperium. Adobaizā Aoi The Adobaizā is the personal advisor of to the Emperor and spiritual leader of the Imperium, and since she administers the daily operation of the empire, Aoi wields considerable internal power. Forum Delegates: Daimyo Akabashi Daimyo Ikoma Four Common Names: Mio Koharu Souta Haru Language of Inspiration: Japanese Principality of Vi The people of the Principality of Vi are deeply religious as the Church of Kroina, the goddess of foresight holds vast power within the principality and as of late increasingly opposed to arcane magic.\nGovernment Structure One of the notable things to be aware of with the Principality is that while the Princess has the most power on paper, the people of the principality are very deeply religious, so much political power also resides in the Church and the Highpriest. Most \"laws\" within the principality are actually Holy Mandates from the church. The current highpriest, Orden Wur, has been leaning a crack down on arcane magic since he came to power 32 years ago. The Church also enforces its Mandates, leaving the formal government primarily dealing with other government and managing the relation between the Principality and the Koncord.\nLocations Capital City: Cerca - A fortress city on the shore of the Carter Lake, home to the Princess's Palace and the Central Cathedral. Secondary City: Vurki - The economic center of the Principality, as the Church dictates a separation between the divine and the mundane of the economy. People Four Important NPCs: Highpriest Orden Wur Princess Luria Vi Hereditary Princess Viven Vi (daughter of the Princess) Liaison to the Church, Mu Sarka The official bridge between the Princess and the Highpriest. Four Common Names: Bur Juska Stef Ami Language Tools: Names should be short with long vowel sounds. See the Jamaican Names fantasy name generator. Roksduens In the east of the Great Basin lies a desert and a constant struggle for survival. Raids from savages outside the Basin make the harsh life here even harder. Due the extreme nature of Roksduens, their formal government is limited and most of their cultural practices are designed to help them survive the extreme environment. One such example utilizes a unique type of creatures called ediolons which bond with a particular summoner. The summoners frequently have duels between ediolons as training for the raids that are sure to follow.\nGovernment Structure There are six tribes that comprise the Roksduens,\nTomo: Located in the center of the Roksduens, this tribe is the closest that the Roks have to a trade hub and because of that one of the only ones who can organize things across tribes. Tema: Run over out of a large village on the Western border of Roksduens. This is the only place information gets into or out of the Roksduens, making it a critically important among the otherwise ignorant Roks. Kuraab: South of the deserts are some rain forests, and in the rain forests are the hunter gatherer tribe of Kuraab, harvesting exotic plants from forests. Kricrem: In the northern parts of Roksduens the rolling hills start to give away to mountains and here lie the Kricrem tribe. The Kricrem are focused on innovation and artifice, but despite their hard work the raids destroy most of their progress. Calchiroos: Sitting on the Eastern border of Roks, the Calchiroos tribe is beaten each and every day, either by the harsh desert or the near constant raids. Kuboma: Next of the Svängbar river is the fishing Kuboma tribe. Locations Capital City: Tomo or Tema would probably fill that role. People Important NPCs: Hibiscian Saffren, Elder of Tomo Tribe Rabiat Talare, Elder of Tema Tribe Blota Trad, Elder of Kuraab Tribe Iskall Stenson, Elder of Kricrem Tribe Sandiga Ridbyxor, Elder of Calchiroos Tribe Lugna Vatten, Elder of Kuboma Tribe Forum Delegates: Vild Klinga Hjartat av Sangen Task Force Members: Redfern Taiga The Koncord of Kieros After the nascent governments had solidified their hold on regional power structures, it became clear that some structure was required to prevent the loss of life as the new powers jostled for position. The result was the Koncord of Kieros, a diplomatic forum where the nations could discuss their grievances and seek redress without resorting to war. Interestingly, there is no founding document for the Koncord, merely fragments of Kieros's journal and centuries of tradition.\nThe ruling council of the Koncord is called the Forum, composed of two delegates from each nation. The powers of the Forum are intentionally ill defined and wide ranging. Anything to prevent a war within the basin. The Forum operates on a system of resolutions and grievances. Resolutions are non-enforceable decrees that all members should follow, while grievances are allegations of wrong doing filed be a plaintiff against a respondent. Resolutions can to anything from mandate the market price of goods or add and remove members from the council. Grievances have been used to stop executions of high value political prisoners, expose spies or do things as petty as force a kingdom to take down unflattering artwork of another kingdom’s ruler.\nIf no resolutions or grievances have been filled about a topic, then the Koncord has no official stance on it and anything goes. The few times it has become an issue, the Forum’s parliamentarian has ruled that resolutions are binding across multiple instances of an issue but grievances are never binding outside of their original context, however they can be argued as precedent in future rulings on any issue.\nKerkard Clearly whichever government hosted the Forum meetings would have considerably more power over the meeting than the rest. A neutral location was needed and the heart of Xylte was still floating above the basin. A meeting place was soon established on top of this massive piece of floating rock and over the years developed into a large city. It is a mixing pot of people and good from all over the Basin.\nForum Delegates There are twenty forum delegates and five spacial roles.\nHerske: The formal head of the Forum, equivalent to a Prime Minister. They control the schedule for the Forum and are also the tie-breaking vote. Krig: The military leader and coordinator for all joint military operations that the Koncord conducts. Regler: The parliamentarian who maintains the rules and protocols of the Forum. Viden: Scientific and arcane liaison, required to oversee research that the Koncord funds and track recent developments by the arcane schools of the Basin. Penge: Economic advisor and regulates inter-state trade. While they are listed with their respective government, the delegates are also listed here.\nArendelle Murtagh Freya Atreides Duchy Lord Andrew Cantort Lady Elizabeth Cantort (Regler) Commune of Atrxous Brigita Cervinkov Leopold Kadlec Eichen Kingdom Marchi Elenek (Krig) Barno Henchor Empire of Xylte Janus Brutus (Viden) Silvius Albina Kingdom of Galimatias Jacob Nowak (Penge) Lilka Moonriver Kingdom of Trobreryn Videla Parre Peric Abell Niven Imperium Akabashi Osa Ikoma Sakome Principality of Vi Bur Harcosa (Herske) Vessimur Yutros Roksduens Vild Klinga Hjärtat av Sången Secondary Organization There are three notable secondary organizations that are run by the Koncord.\nLibrary of the Muse: The official library and record keeping body of the Koncord. This is the organization that Oisin is attached to and his reason for being in the task force. Truthspeakers: A network of bards paid by the Koncord to deliver the news of the forum to the Koncord. Bastion of the Sky: The police of Kerkard and enforces of the Koncord. It is a small guard force who only has jurisdiction on Kerkard or if explicitly granted by the Forum. The Task Force At the annual Founder's Gala at the end of Goldwave, all of the delegates and dignitaries gather and acknowledge the history of the Koncord and remember the Shattering.\nDuring this event, an explosion went off and the Sword of Divinity was stolen. This sword was on Xylte when the first explorers managed to let back to the floating asteroid and was wielded by Kieros herself during her heroic effort to save the Basin.\nA task force was created to recover the sword, and the player characters were selected to serve on that Task Force.\nA chronicle of the activities of the Task Force can be found on this website. However, notable events include:\n34 Goldwave 1763: The Sword of Divinity is stolen.\n02 Fireharvest 1763: Jusa Lok appointed as task force member from the Principality of Vi (NPC Cleric).\n03 Fireharvest 1763: Alisha Shamra found potentially tampering with the Trance Wine in the Church of Kroina on Kerkard.\n05 Fireharvest 1763: Task Force obtains warrant and raids Alisha's shop for potential burglary crimes and selling illegal drugs.\n09 Fireharvest 1763: In a report to the Forum, the task force recommends opening the docks with additional security restrictions.\n19 Fireharvest 1763: In the middle of the night, a quite blast wakes up several members of the task force. A search reveals a large fire burning in Taerwyn, the capital of Trobreryn which is near where Kerkard is floating. During the following days, the task force uncovers evidence that the explosion was caused by the same explosive which was found at the site of the Forum bombing. Not only that, but also that the explosive was distributed by the Keburipemi Syndicate, a large organized crime group from the Niven Imperium.\nWhile infiltrating a Keburipemi safe house, the task force meets Niwa, an evidently high ranking member of the syndicate looking to embarrass the one running the Taerwyn operation, an undine named Vicious.\n22 Fireharvest 1763: Using the evacuation plans leaked by Niwa, the Task Force collaborates with the Taerwyn guard lead by Nessa Preston to apprehend them. The resulting operation is mostly a success, capturing the boat and a substantial amount of drugs. While Vicious managed to escape, his underling Voracious was captured.\n28 Fireharvest 1763: A packet of documents comes into the procession of the Task Force, a letter from Niwa explaining more of the details of the explosive, called Cylex, and how they were going to sell it to a group in the Eichen Kingdom.\n32 Fireharvest 1763: The rescheduled sale of the Cylex takes place in Daquin, a small town in Trobreryn. Thanks to the heads up from Niwa, the Task Force is able to intercept both parties and apprehend the 30 pound barrel of Cylex. The leader of the Eichen delegation, Marius Kleinheisterkamp is captured.\n33 Fireharvest 1763: During an interrogation with Marius (who has been rendered blind by Oisin), the task force learns about a group of disenchanted Eichen wounded veterans who believe that the government is conducting experiments on their soldiers. When Zorro and his sword learn about this later, the sword dominates Zorro and attempts to Coup de Grâce a bound Marius. He is unsuccessful thanks to quick intervention by Oisin, Redfern and Breagan.\n03 Shimmerfall 1763: After several days of travel, the Task Force arrives back in Kerkard and books Marius and a lackey from the Syndicate into the prison their.\n04 Shimmerfall 1763: While Oisin and Breagan are attending the Annual Symposium of Arcane Masters, the rest of the Task Force interrogates Voracious. He seeks willing to talk and reveals that he and Vicious where once pirates on a ship called the Sanguine Ravager and that Vicious is a member of the group which stole the Sword of Divinity, a group called the League Against Koncord Eminence before his prison cell is flooded with negative energy and he dies. When Eaton, the investigative head of the Bastion of the Sky, tries to investigate Voracious's death, the Task Force refuses to answer question except those from the Forum, forcing Eaton to call an emergency Forum session. At said session, the members of the Forum pressed the Task Force for answer, and they likewise refused to answer specifics, threatening to reveal dirty secrets on each government who threatened them again. The Delegates decided not press further.\n07 Shimmerfall 1763: Steven Hetzler, the truthspeaker of Kerkard, leaks that the Sword of Divinity has been stolen during bombing. However, the task force was not metioned.\n10 Shimmerfall 1763: The Task Force attends the Niven Lantern Festival under the guidance of Delegate Ikoma. After the Task Force steals Raifusutīrā, the life stealing katana, Niwa whisks them away to an unknown location in the Niven forest.\nCalendar The post shattering calendar has 6 day weeks, named after Kerios and her five heralds. The suffix for day is \"daq\" pronounced \"dack\".\nKierdaq Azeedaq Gradaq Xuldaq Izudaq Rimedaq The year itself has 11 months, based on two yearly harvests, one of summer crops and one of winter crops as listed below. The year starts with a planting festival.\nSproutmoor (35 days) Verdantwave (35 days) Goldwave (34 days) Fireharvest (36 days) Shimmerfall (33 days) Whitermire (34 days) Frostgain (33 days) Iceharvest (35 days) Darknight (33 days) Snowdwindle (36 days) Riverrun (34 days) For a total of 378 days per year with 2 leap days, one in Fireharvest and one in Darknight every time the year is 1 mod 3 so those years have 380 days.\nThis realm has two moons, the larger one is Zion, Bringer of War and the smaller one is Izrail, Bringer of Peace.\nZion is so named due to its reddest hue while Izrail has a bright white hue, brighter than our moon Luna. Their is a lot of superstition regarding the moons and astrology and like what time of the moon cycles are best for assassinations and peace treaties, etc.\n","wordCount":"4075","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-11-17T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-11-17T00:00:00Z","author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Matt

href=#the-shattering>#</a></h1><p>Nearly 1,800 years ago, a new star appeared in the sky over a land we
know frighteningly little about. What we do know is that all of the
oracles, augurs and sibyls of this land started receiving constant
visions of death and calamity on a scale that they'd never seen. Years
pasted, and the star grew brighter and brighter in the night sky, now
called Xylte, Destroyer of Worlds promised doom to all that lived below.</p><p>A band of heroes then rose with a plan to save the land from certain
destruction.</p><ul><li>Kieros, Herald of Divinity</li><li>Gralf, Herald of Courage</li><li>Azeem, Herald of Foresight</li><li>Izuka, Herald of Knowledge</li><li>Rimev, Herald of Happiness</li><li>Xul, Herald of Stealth</li></ul><p>It was only through their work that civilization survived the impact of
Xylte, an event now known as the Shattering. While we don't know how
they did it, what we do know is that afterwards the heart of the Star of
Death was suspended over a newly formed basin.</p><p>These events occurred 1763 years ago. For the next several hundred
years, records are incomplete and little is known.</p><h1 id=the-basin-today>The Basin Today<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-basin-today>#</a></h1><p>The Great Basin as it has become is currently divided into ten kingdoms

The largest difference between the people in the book and the people

directly above the Principality of Vi. The government of the Duchy is
centered around the Duke and Duchess, currently Leto and Jessica
Atreides. There capital city of Caladan is not opulent like some other
capital cities, but it is very welcoming. That describes the Atreides
people well, not the wealthiest, but very generous and sharing with
others. They are one of the first to offer assistance to other kingdoms
and because of this are generally well liked by the other members of the
Koncord.</p><h3 id=government-structure-1>Government Structure<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#government-structure-1>#</a></h3><p>The title of Duke is hereditary, pasted from parents to the eldest child
through the generations. The Duke and Duchess serve as the executive
seat of power, directing the military and negotiating with the other
kingdoms. Laws are enforced by the Duke and Duchess but passed by the
Landsraad, a legislature consisting of representatives from towns and
cities of the Duchy with a set number of representatives per population
bracket. Individual cities are able to pick representative however they
feel.</p><h3 id=locations-1>Locations<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#locations-1>#</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Capital City</strong>: Caladan</li><li><strong>Secondary Cities:</strong><ul><li>Acadia</li><li>Bellfort</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id=people-1>People<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#people-1>#</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Four Important Figures:</strong><ul><li>Duke Leto Atreides</li><li>Duchess Jessica Atreides</li><li>Master at Arms Gurney Halleck<ul><li>Leader of the military forces of the Duchy.

the Commune of Atrxous. This government is communism, enforced via a
magic contract called The Atrxous. Once you sign the contract, you agree
to share all of your wealth, shed your social status and live for the
betterment of the Commune. Violating the contract is impossible,
enforced via enchantment magic and the transmutation of the valuable to
the worthless.</p><h3 id=government-structure-2>Government Structure<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#government-structure-2>#</a></h3><p>Formally speaking, there is no structure to the government since there
is effectively no government. Generally there is no need for one either

who have signed it.</p><h3 id=locations-2>Locations<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#locations-2>#</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Capital City:</strong> (If they formally had one) Atrxous - Hardly more

exclusively by shape-changing anthropomorphic squirrels (A re-flavored

sense of community. There is also a strong worship of Grosse
Eichornchen, the squirrel god.</p><h3 id=government-structure-3>Government Structure<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#government-structure-3>#</a></h3><p>Unlike most monarchies where the title is passed down by blood, the
title of King or Queen in the Eichen Kingdom is determined by a series
of challenges including sparring (unarmed and armed), survival tests and
quizzes about the history of the Kingdom and military tactics. After the
challenges, the populous votes in a ranked-choice election.</p><p>Once elected, the monarch rules for life and near-complete control over

conquered land after the founding of the Koncord. The Empire started as
Republic before a series of increasingly brutal civil wars caused the
Republic of Xylte to condense and centralize power into a Consul who
then overthrew the Senate and declared an Empire.</p><h3 id=government-structure-4>Government Structure<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#government-structure-4>#</a></h3><p>The Imperial Cult of Xylte recognizes the Emperor, his wife and first

of Ændor in 1623. A small satellite nation of elves on the western
border of the Empire. After years of aggressive behavior, when
Ændor's King died it was the perfect time for Xylte to take over.
After stripping Ændor of its legal protection, the army of Xylte
invaded, burning the small nation nearly to the ground. Many
military strategists believe that the only reason that the Ændorran
elves weren't completely massacred was the presence of troops from
the Ecihen Kingdom.</p><ol><li><p>People</p><ul><li><strong>Task Force Members:</strong><ul><li>Oisin</li></ul></li></ul></li></ol></li></ol><h3 id=people-5>People<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#people-5>#</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Important NPCs:</strong><ul><li>Emperor Falto Tatius</li><li>Imperial Legate Brutus Halburn</li></ul></li><li><strong>Forum Delegates:</strong><ul><li>Silvius Albina</li><li>Janus Brutus</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id=kingdom-of-galimatias>Kingdom of Galimatias<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#kingdom-of-galimatias>#</a></h2><p>A progressive kingdom with a issue with undead, Galimatias is the
economic hub of the basin, rich in materials from the most mountainous
parts of the boundary ring and fertile fields. Cultural festivals are a
cornerstone of the Galimatian year, with three major festivals
celebrating birth, death and the renewal of the year.</p><h3 id=government-structure-5>Government Structure<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#government-structure-5>#</a></h3><p>The government is controlled by a King and Queen, a title passed down by
blood, who rule with a divine mandate from the two primary deities of
the land, Perun the God of Guidance and Mokosz the Goddess of Earth.
While the Church also holds considerable political power, the monarchy
is firming in control of both domestic and foreign policy.</p><h3 id=locations-4>Locations<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#locations-4>#</a></h3><p>Galimatias is divided into several districts</p><ul><li>Jeden - Farming district</li><li>Dwa - Fishing district</li><li>Piec - Research district</li><li>Siedem - Business district</li><li>Osiem - Mining district</li></ul><h3 id=people-6>People<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#people-6>#</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Important NPCs:</strong><ul><li>Queen Tekli Shadowmend</li><li>King Bennett James</li><li>Prince Valintin</li></ul></li><li><strong>Forum Delegates:</strong><ul><li>Jacob Nowak</li><li>Lilka Moonriver</li></ul></li><li><strong>Task Force Members:</strong><ul><li>Breagan</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id=kingdom-of-trobreryn>Kingdom of Trobreryn<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#kingdom-of-trobreryn>#</a></h2><p>A mercantile kingdom and the shipping hub of the Basin. Although each
nation has a territorial boundary waters extending into Kratermeer, the
majority of the lake is ruled as territorial waters of Trobreryn,
allowing them to control most of the boat traffic on the lake.</p><h3 id=government-structure-6>Government Structure<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#government-structure-6>#</a></h3><p>Formally the Kingdom of Trobreryn is a monarchy, ruled by the Rosach
family. However, a guild system also exists which regulates the
lucrative trade economy. The monthly formal meeting between the monarch
and the guild leaders is called the Guildmaster Gathering.</p><p>Notable guilds include:</p><ul><li>Merchant Guild</li><li>Mage Guild</li><li>Bard Guild</li><li>Farmer Guild</li><li>Builder Guild</li><li>Medical Guild</li><li>Non-denominational Clerics Guild</li></ul><h3 id=locations-5>Locations<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#locations-5>#</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Capital City:</strong> Taerwyn</li></ul><h3 id=people-7>People<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#people-7>#</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Important NPCs:</strong><ul><li>King Miall Rosach</li><li>Captain of the Guard Nessa Preston</li><li>Merchant Guidlmaster Foalan Ragnory</li></ul></li><li><strong>Forum Delegates:</strong><ul><li>Hand of the King Videla Parre</li><li>Hand of the Guilds Peric Abell</li></ul></li><li><strong>Task Force Members:</strong><ul><li>Wil Ragnory</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id=niven-imperium>Niven Imperium<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#niven-imperium>#</a></h2><p>The Niven Imperium is undoubted a force to be reckoned with, if they
ever wanted to. This government is relatively isolationist and stagnant.
That last major reform was implemented over 200 years ago. While the
three major cities are decadent and bustling, the status of the villages
and farmers is relatively unknown. The Imperium is also known to be the
only government with several settlements on the outer flanks of the
boundary ridge of the Basin.</p><h3 id=government-structure-7>Government Structure<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#government-structure-7>#</a></h3><p>The Imperium is ruled by an Emperor, who has absolute power but rarely
uses it. Most of the daily administration of the Imperium is facilitated
between military leader, the Shogun and the primary advisor to the
Emperor, who uses the title of Adobaizā.</p><h3 id=places>Places<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#places>#</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Capital City:</strong><ul><li>Daitoshi - An absolutely massive city rife with vice and

as a research station working with rare mountain ores but has
since grown into a large alpine city. It is still home to the
Machi Laboratories, a renowned research facility that seems to
be in decline, overtaken by newer facilities in other kingdoms.</li><li>Mura - Smaller than even Machi, Mura is the agricultural hub of
the empire, where farmers come from the fertile plains below the

principality and as of late increasingly opposed to arcane magic.</p><h3 id=government-structure-8>Government Structure<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#government-structure-8>#</a></h3><p>One of the notable things to be aware of with the Principality is that
while the Princess has the most power on paper, the people of the
principality are very deeply religious, so much political power also
resides in the Church and the Highpriest. Most "laws" within the
principality are actually Holy Mandates from the church. The current
highpriest, Orden Wur, has been leaning a crack down on arcane magic
since he came to power 32 years ago. The Church also enforces its
Mandates, leaving the formal government primarily dealing with other
government and managing the relation between the Principality and the
Koncord.</p><h3 id=locations-6>Locations<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#locations-6>#</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Capital City:</strong><ul><li>Cerca - A fortress city on the shore of the Carter Lake, home to

survival. Raids from savages outside the Basin make the harsh life here
even harder. Due the extreme nature of Roksduens, their formal
government is limited and most of their cultural practices are designed
to help them survive the extreme environment. One such example utilizes
a unique type of creatures called ediolons which bond with a particular
summoner. The summoners frequently have duels between ediolons as
training for the raids that are sure to follow.</p><h3 id=government-structure-9>Government Structure<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#government-structure-9>#</a></h3><p>There are six tribes that comprise the Roksduens,</p><ul><li><em>Tomo:</em> Located in the center of the Roksduens, this tribe is the
closest that the Roks have to a trade hub and because of that one of
the only ones who can organize things across tribes.</li><li><em>Tema:</em> Run over out of a large village on the Western border of
Roksduens. This is the only place information gets into or out of
the Roksduens, making it a critically important among the otherwise
ignorant Roks.</li><li><em>Kuraab:</em> South of the deserts are some rain forests, and in the
rain forests are the hunter gatherer tribe of Kuraab, harvesting
exotic plants from forests.</li><li><em>Kricrem:</em> In the northern parts of Roksduens the rolling hills
start to give away to mountains and here lie the Kricrem tribe. The
Kricrem are focused on innovation and artifice, but despite their
hard work the raids destroy most of their progress.</li><li><em>Calchiroos:</em> Sitting on the Eastern border of Roks, the Calchiroos
tribe is beaten each and every day, either by the harsh desert or
the near constant raids.</li><li><em>Kuboma:</em> Next of the Svängbar river is the fishing Kuboma tribe.</li></ul><h3 id=locations-7>Locations<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#locations-7>#</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Capital City:</strong> Tomo or Tema would probably fill that role.</li></ul><h3 id=people-10>People<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#people-10>#</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Important NPCs:</strong><ul><li>Hibiscian Saffren, Elder of Tomo Tribe</li><li>Rabiat Talare, Elder of Tema Tribe</li><li>Blota Trad, Elder of Kuraab Tribe</li><li>Iskall Stenson, Elder of Kricrem Tribe</li><li>Sandiga Ridbyxor, Elder of Calchiroos Tribe</li><li>Lugna Vatten, Elder of Kuboma Tribe</li></ul></li><li><strong>Forum Delegates:</strong><ul><li>Vild Klinga</li><li>Hjartat av Sangen</li></ul></li><li><strong>Task Force Members:</strong><ul><li>Redfern Taiga</li></ul></li></ul><h1 id=the-koncord-of-kieros>The Koncord of Kieros<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-koncord-of-kieros>#</a></h1><p>After the nascent governments had solidified their hold on regional
power structures, it became clear that some structure was required to
prevent the loss of life as the new powers jostled for position. The
result was the Koncord of Kieros, a diplomatic forum where the nations
could discuss their grievances and seek redress without resorting to
war. Interestingly, there is no founding document for the Koncord,
merely fragments of Kieros's journal and centuries of tradition.</p><p>The ruling council of the Koncord is called the Forum, composed of two
delegates from each nation. The powers of the Forum are intentionally
ill defined and wide ranging. Anything to prevent a war within the
basin. The Forum operates on a system of resolutions and grievances.
Resolutions are non-enforceable decrees that all members should follow,
while grievances are allegations of wrong doing filed be a plaintiff
against a respondent. Resolutions can to anything from mandate the
market price of goods or add and remove members from the council.
Grievances have been used to stop executions of high value political
prisoners, expose spies or do things as petty as force a kingdom to take
down unflattering artwork of another kingdom&rsquo;s ruler.</p><p>If no resolutions or grievances have been filled about a topic, then the
Koncord has no official stance on it and anything goes. The few times it
has become an issue, the Forum&rsquo;s parliamentarian has ruled that
resolutions are binding across multiple instances of an issue but
grievances are never binding outside of their original context, however
they can be argued as precedent in future rulings on any issue.</p><h2 id=kerkard>Kerkard<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#kerkard>#</a></h2><p>Clearly whichever government hosted the Forum meetings would have
considerably more power over the meeting than the rest. A neutral
location was needed and the heart of Xylte was still floating above the
basin. A meeting place was soon established on top of this massive piece
of floating rock and over the years developed into a large city. It is a
mixing pot of people and good from all over the Basin.</p><h2 id=forum-delegates>Forum Delegates<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#forum-delegates>#</a></h2><p>There are twenty forum delegates and five spacial roles.</p><ol><li><strong>Herske:</strong> The formal head of the Forum, equivalent to a Prime

Koncord.</p><ul><li><strong>Library of the Muse:</strong> The official library and record keeping
body of the Koncord. This is the organization that Oisin is attached
to and his reason for being in the task force.</li><li><strong>Truthspeakers:</strong> A network of bards paid by the Koncord to deliver
the news of the forum to the Koncord.</li><li><strong>Bastion of the Sky:</strong> The police of Kerkard and enforces of the
Koncord. It is a small guard force who only has jurisdiction on
Kerkard or if explicitly granted by the Forum.</li></ul><h1 id=the-task-force>The Task Force<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-task-force>#</a></h1><p>At the annual Founder's Gala at the end of Goldwave, all of the
delegates and dignitaries gather and acknowledge the history of the
Koncord and remember the Shattering.</p><p>During this event, an explosion went off and the Sword of Divinity was
stolen. This sword was on Xylte when the first explorers managed to let
back to the floating asteroid and was wielded by Kieros herself during
her heroic effort to save the Basin.</p><p>A task force was created to recover the sword, and the player characters
were selected to serve on that Task Force.</p><p>A chronicle of the activities of the Task Force can be found on this
website. However, notable events include:</p><ul><li><p>34 Goldwave 1763: The Sword of Divinity is stolen.</p></li><li><p>02 Fireharvest 1763: Jusa Lok appointed as task force member from
the Principality of Vi (NPC Cleric).</p></li><li><p>03 Fireharvest 1763: Alisha Shamra found potentially tampering with
the Trance Wine in the Church of Kroina on Kerkard.</p></li><li><p>05 Fireharvest 1763: Task Force obtains warrant and raids Alisha's
shop for potential burglary crimes and selling illegal drugs.</p></li><li><p>09 Fireharvest 1763: In a report to the Forum, the task force
recommends opening the docks with additional security restrictions.</p></li><li><p>19 Fireharvest 1763: In the middle of the night, a quite blast wakes
up several members of the task force. A search reveals a large fire
burning in Taerwyn, the capital of Trobreryn which is near where
Kerkard is floating. During the following days, the task force
uncovers evidence that the explosion was caused by the same
explosive which was found at the site of the Forum bombing. Not only
that, but also that the explosive was distributed by the Keburipemi
Syndicate, a large organized crime group from the Niven Imperium.</p><p>While infiltrating a Keburipemi safe house, the task force meets
Niwa, an evidently high ranking member of the syndicate looking to
embarrass the one running the Taerwyn operation, an undine named
Vicious.</p></li><li><p>22 Fireharvest 1763: Using the evacuation plans leaked by Niwa, the
Task Force collaborates with the Taerwyn guard lead by Nessa Preston
to apprehend them. The resulting operation is mostly a success,
capturing the boat and a substantial amount of drugs. While Vicious
managed to escape, his underling Voracious was captured.</p></li><li><p>28 Fireharvest 1763: A packet of documents comes into the procession
of the Task Force, a letter from Niwa explaining more of the details
of the explosive, called Cylex, and how they were going to sell it
to a group in the Eichen Kingdom.</p></li><li><p>32 Fireharvest 1763: The rescheduled sale of the Cylex takes place
in Daquin, a small town in Trobreryn. Thanks to the heads up from
Niwa, the Task Force is able to intercept both parties and apprehend
the 30 pound barrel of Cylex. The leader of the Eichen delegation,
Marius Kleinheisterkamp is captured.</p></li><li><p>33 Fireharvest 1763: During an interrogation with Marius (who has
been rendered blind by Oisin), the task force learns about a group
of disenchanted Eichen wounded veterans who believe that the
government is conducting experiments on their soldiers. When Zorro
and his sword learn about this later, the sword dominates Zorro and
attempts to Coup de Grâce a bound Marius. He is unsuccessful thanks
to quick intervention by Oisin, Redfern and Breagan.</p></li><li><p>03 Shimmerfall 1763: After several days of travel, the Task Force
arrives back in Kerkard and books Marius and a lackey from the
Syndicate into the prison their.</p></li><li><p>04 Shimmerfall 1763: While Oisin and Breagan are attending the
Annual Symposium of Arcane Masters, the rest of the Task Force
interrogates Voracious. He seeks willing to talk and reveals that he
and Vicious where once pirates on a ship called the <em>Sanguine
Ravager</em> and that Vicious is a member of the group which stole the
Sword of Divinity, a group called the League Against Koncord
Eminence before his prison cell is flooded with negative energy and
he dies. When Eaton, the investigative head of the Bastion of the
Sky, tries to investigate Voracious's death, the Task Force refuses
to answer question except those from the Forum, forcing Eaton to
call an emergency Forum session. At said session, the members of the
Forum pressed the Task Force for answer, and they likewise refused
to answer specifics, threatening to reveal dirty secrets on each
government who threatened them again. The Delegates decided not
press further.</p></li><li><p>07 Shimmerfall 1763: Steven Hetzler, the truthspeaker of Kerkard,
leaks that the Sword of Divinity has been stolen during bombing.
However, the task force was not metioned.</p></li><li><p>10 Shimmerfall 1763: The Task Force attends the Niven Lantern
Festival under the guidance of Delegate Ikoma. After the Task Force
steals Raifusutīrā, the life stealing katana, Niwa whisks them away
to an unknown location in the Niven forest.</p></li></ul><h1 id=calendar>Calendar<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#calendar>#</a></h1><p>The post shattering calendar has 6 day weeks, named after Kerios and her
five heralds. The suffix for day is "daq" pronounced "dack".</p><ul><li>Kierdaq</li><li>Azeedaq</li><li>Gradaq</li><li>Xuldaq</li><li>Izudaq</li><li>Rimedaq</li></ul><p>The year itself has 11 months, based on two yearly harvests, one of

smaller one is Izrail, Bringer of Peace.</p><p>Zion is so named due to its reddest hue while Izrail has a bright white
hue, brighter than our moon Luna. Their is a lot of superstition
regarding the moons and astrology and like what time of the moon cycles
are best for assassinations and peace treaties, etc.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul></footer></article></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2022 <a href=https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/>The Great Basin</a></span>
