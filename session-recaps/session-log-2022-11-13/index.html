After a conversation with the owner of the Midnight Lotus, Takayama, the party believed that Niwa wanted them steal Raifusutīrā, the life stealing katana. Their mission was further complicated by realizing that Ikoma would be their chaperon for the night.\nTo start, the members asked for a tour of the Palace. While Ikoma didn't lead you into a room titled \"Super Powerful Artifact Storage\", you did note several staircases leading down, which is where Takayama mentioned the artifacts could be found. After the tour, while enjoying some nice food, Zorro was the first to enter the sparring rink with member of the Niven military. Unfortunately, he did not feel comfortable wielding the Niven wooden katana and didn't advance out of the first round. Later, however, Wil and Blue Eyes both advanced out of the first round, using various class abilities to gain proficiency with weapon.\nAs the rest of the party, minus Breagan, foundered to create a plan, Wil and Blue Eyes continued to advance in the tournament. Wil was eliminated by a Daimyo, but Blue Eyes managed to defeat a Daimyo and advance to face the Emperor of the Niven Imperium.\nMeanwhile, Jusa was using her Remote Viewing ability to probe the basement for the location of an artifact vault. While the rest of the party was engaged with the fight between Blue Eyes and the Emperor, Oisin, Zorro and Jusa slipped down a staircase. Using Adjustable Disguise, Oisin disguised himself to look like Ikoma and convinced the guards to let him pass. Once the vault had been located, Oisin used Knock to open the door to the vault. Inside the vault, you saw seven artifacts, one on each side of an octagonal room.\nAn average looking katana. A clockwork cube. A jawbone tied to a leather chord. A shard of silvery metal. A large iridescent gemstone. A rusty ring. A glass orb with a heavy bronze sheen. Opening the glass compartment triggered a spring loaded dart which struck Oisin. Fortunately some quick first aid pervented the poison on the dart from taking affect. Inside the container was a holographic projector which hide the physical katana from being displayed. While the room itself was a powerful anti-magic field specialized to suppress artifact level items, so upon leaving Oisin slid the weapon into his bag. When the group arrived back at the courtyard, the corpse of a Daimyo lay next to the sparring ring. Naturally the palace was locked down pending an investigation. After about an hour, the Adobaizā, a special advisor to the Emperor and spiritual leader, called the task force and Ikoma to a conference room in the Palace. She dismissed Ikoma quickly, despite her protests, and then revealed herself to be Niwa, pulling what almost looked like a mask off as she rose to full height. After confirming that they had the item she needed, she simply stated that she still needed your help and pulled out a bottom of gray liquid and smashed it, teleporting the task force into the middle of the forest. When Niwa asked if you needed rest, you decided to push forward.\nAfter four hours of walking, we resume at a spirit gate where you have been challenged by a suite of spiritual armor. It did not seem keen on letting you pass, insisting that your quest was going to disrupt the flow of nature. It also hinted to Breagan that the task force had been keeping her in the dark.\n","wordCount":"634","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-11-13T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-11-13T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Matt Schwennesen"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/session-recaps/session-log-2022-11-13/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Great Basin","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/ accesskey=h title="The Great Basin (Alt + H)">The Great Basin</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/docs/ title=Documents><span>Documents</span></a></li><li><a href=https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/stats/ title="Stat Blocks"><span>Stat Blocks</span></a></li><li><a href=https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/session-recaps/ title="Session Logs"><span>Session Logs</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/session-recaps/>Session Logs</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Session Log (2022-11-13)</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-11-13 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>November 13, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;3 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;Matt Schwennesen&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/tree/exampleSite/content/session-recaps/session-log-2022-11-13.org rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><div id=outline-container-headline-1 class=outline-2><h2 id=headline-1>Session Recap</h2><div id=outline-text-headline-1 class=outline-text-2><p>When we last ventured to the Great Basin,</p><p>It was the 10th of Shimmerfall, 1763 and the annual Niven Lantern Festival,
