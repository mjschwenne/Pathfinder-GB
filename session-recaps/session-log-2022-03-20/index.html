After a feisty battle which saw several sun beetles’ glowing guts getting scattered over the room, the creatures were defeated and upon death, they transformed into the corpses of regular boars.\nTalking with Pastor Kendall of the Temple, you learned that this temple has been buying Trance Wine from Alisha for four years since she is able to get great deals for it and that occasionally she brings another to help with the work, but it’s not always one person like Diana. On the way back from the temple, the party filled Jusa Lok in the details of the investigation, that the blood on the coin found at the site of the 1763-03-34 Bombing of the Forum belonged to the last king of Andorr, Ydin.\nConvinced that Alisha may be connected to their investigation, or at the very least a shady character, Oisin goes to talk to Eaton about the steps needed to search her Herbal Remedies and Tattoo shop. Eaton said that you had the authority to talk her, but a full search would require a warrant signed by any member of the Forum. The task force then splits, with a group consisting of Luna, Oisin, and Zorro visiting Rokkaku_s Ramen for some good noodles. While there, Oisin, who is the only regular customer from the group asks Rokkaku why the place feels dead. “6p on an Izudaq? The place should be hoppin.” Rokkaku told him that since the docks are still closed after the bombing of the forum, the docker workers aren’t getting paid and can’t affort to eat out. He also expressed concern about being able to source indgredents from the Niven Imperium if the docks stay closed for too much longer.\nMeanwhile, a different group consisting of Breagan, Redfern, Blue Eyes, Wil and Jusa Lok were dining in the Kingdom of Galimatias with Breagan’s parents on typical polish fare. Jacob Nowak, her father is a member of the forum and her mother Ola is the event coordinator of the royal castle of the Kingdom. Over dinner you talked to Jacob about signing a warrant to search Alisha’s Herbal Remedies and Tattoo Parlor and he expressed some concern about this being outside the scope of the task force since their was no concrete evidence connecting her to the thief of the sword. Eventually, he agreed to sign the warrant on the condition that Eaton accompany the task force. There was also a conversation between Breagan and Jacob right as the task force was leaving where he expressed concern over Breagan’s well being and mentioned that the Krig Marchi Elenek wanted to jail the members of the task force if they didn’t agree join.\nLater then evening, Oisin’s familiar returned from scouting Alisha’s shop. They reported that they did not see Alisha or Diana there, but gave a description of three others working in the shop.\nA human with a green pixie hair cut and lots of tattoos. She also went out back into an alley for a smoke break, and the back door seemed to be unlocked before and after she was in the ally. A dwarf who must be very young, since he only has a few inches of beard. “That’s really the only way I know to estimate the age of a dwarf”. Another vishkayna, this one with green eyes rather they the golden ones that Alisha has.
