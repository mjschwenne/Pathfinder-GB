Soon thereafter, Keburipemi himself rose from the lava as much as he come, exposing a single eye. However, he was still able to unleash destruction across the battlefield.\nHighlights of the battle include:\nMeru using Obscuring Mist to block the effects of the Black Mask's gaze attack. Wil knocking out the Red Mask with a single blow. Redfern summoning a Cerberi. The Red Mask's scream causing all but Breagan to flee in terror. Keburipemi's gaze of hatred causing many members of the Task Force to temporarily attack each other. And of course, the tag team between Zorro and Breagan which lead to the defeat of a God. Zorro used Floating Disk to levitate Breagan, equipped with the life-stealing katana Raifusutīrā, to within striking range of Keburipemi.\nThe traditional slashing strikes proved unable to find purchase on the thick hide of the elder dragon until Breagan finally hefted the sword above her head and slammed it down in a stabbing motion. The dragon strained against the pull of the sword, but his body turned to smoke and was sucked in regardless. Saved only by the floating disk, Breagan quickly retreated to the shore of the lava lake just as the lava itself realized that the dragon was gone and collapsed inward on itself, spraying you all. It was this final splash of lava which did Redfern in, the rest of you carrying his body out of the volcano.\nA safe distance from the monastery, you stopped for a break and Niwa demanded the sword immediately.
