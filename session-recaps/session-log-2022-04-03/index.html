On the 7th, the task force was delivered a message from Vessimur Yutros, a delegate from the Principality of Vi. He told you that all the members of the task force were expected to appear before the assembled Forum in two days time on the 9th. When the task force entered the forum chambers, the delegates were loudly arguing over the protests at the docks two times before and weather the docks should be opened again. Bur Harcosa called the forum to order with a supernaturally loud bang from his gavel and asked the task force to make a report. Oisin stepped up to the plate, and told them that the green substance is the explosive used during the bombing and that it reacts to electricity but is otherwise stable. He also stated that there was no lead on the left glove of bony power and did not mention anything about the coin. The Forum seemed a bit disappointed about the apparent lack of progress, non more-so then Janus Brutus from the Empire of Xylte, who made some “I told you so” comments about the task force being able to look into this matter. The Forum told you to keep investigating.\nThey did want to here your opinion about weather or not to open the docks, since the main reason for keeping them closed was to aid the investigation. During an internal discussion, you all quickly agreed that the docks should be opened, but were not able to agree on what level of activity or regulation should be required. The side championed by Breagan wanted active searches of every vessel coming or going from the city whereas the opposition lead by Redfern advocated a complete reopening. Ultimately, you decided to make a formal recommendation to open the docks but left the details to the Forum delegates. They eventually decided to open the docks completely since that would mean that they wouldn’t need to provide other aid to the dock workers. In a heated moment, Barno Henchor threw a knife at Leopold Kadlec, who surprisingly caught the knife midair and launched it back at Barno.\nEaton and the other head of the Bastion of the Sky, a quiet man in shiny silver full plate armor, then have a report about the investigation following the protests at the docks. Eaton reported that 82 individuals were arrested and they are actively cross-referencing and compiling statements from all of them, but an estimated 150 additional people were at the riot. The organizing group was determined to be a new group calling itself the Kerkard Union of Dock Workers, lead by one Tycho Magnentius from the Empire of Xylte. It seems that they were demanding the immediate opening of the docks and several other, but sometimes conflicting demands about the working conditions in the docks.\nThat night, Breagan’s father paid her a visit to tell her that a family friend, Aleksandra Corrmwell, the Decider of Siedem in the Kingdom of Galimatias was killed while hunting bison on the 8 Fireharvest. The funeral service was on the 15th.\nThe week of the 12th was otherwise devoid of leads and the task force had little work to do, but late into the night on the 19th of Fireharvest, both Wil and Redfern were awoken with a start. Blue Eyes reported hearing something akin to thunder, and they all decided to take a walk, meeting up outside and travelling west to the edge of the city. Looking down, you saw a bright flame, tinged with green below. While it was difficult to localize the origin of the fire, it was determined using the current location of Kerkrad and the fact that the fire was on the shore of Kratermeer that it was on the outskirts of Taerwyn, the capital of Trobreryn.\nRushing to wake up the rest of the task force and the delegates from Trobreryn, Videla Parre and Peric Abell, the task force used the teleportation network to go to Taerwyn. Navigating the city, Wil lead them to a small warehouse which had evidently exploded to assist the fire brigades trying to contain the white-hot blaze. When most of the group came under the affects of a hallucinogen from the fumes, the four sober members, Oisin, Breagan, Wil and Blue Eyes deduced that this was a drug warehouse and started pulling people from the fire, all of them members of the Trobreryn guard. Shortly thereafter, Nessa Preston the captain of the Trobreryn guard arrived on scene with several cyromages as Breagan was searching the debris for the explosive used in the Bombing of the Forum. With a natural 20 on a perception check, she found in the blasted remains of a metal barrel two vials of the substance in question. Nessa explained to the task force that her forces were conducting a drug raid with 24 soldiers. in the Bombing of the Forum.
