Initially their was some doubts on the behalf of Oisin on weather the task force should even be involved with this operation, but Eaton seemed to want you there. Alisha and the staff are not happy to be raiding, at least that is how they view it. Searching the store, and in particular the safe which Germaine Shamra opens for the group, you find a total of eight vials, only two of which are identified as scorpion venom and a drug called Serpent’s Kiss, which is a favorite among the politicians since it increases confidence. The search also revealed a few other substances like soul stimulant and Ambrosia which are drugs that are generally only available in professional healing wards staffed by clerics. While talking to Kjell Blogmer, you learn something very interesting to Redfern: Kjell is originally from Roksduens and his parents somehow left when he was a baby after his older brother was killed during a raid. However, he doesn’t know how they left. The other staff at the shop was Roxanne Lloyd, a 19 year old tattoo artist who learned the trade from Alisha starting at the young age of 14 apparently. She was the most combative with the questioning. The full time apothecary who is considering moving to the new term of pharmacist is Germaine Shamra, a vishkayna with green eyes.\nZorro and Blue Eyes, who had been waiting outside during the bulk of the operation where instructed by Oisin to try to search the apartment above the store which is not included in the warrant. Zorro climbed the wall to find a locked window looking into a small bathroom. Unable to open the window, he was assisted by Oisin’s familiar casting knock. Looking around, the invisible Zorro was not able to find anything unusual in the apartment (but also didn’t check “the places people hide drugs”), before he was heard downstairs by Eaton, several other members of the task force and it would seem Alisha who made several comments about Eaton’s people not being allowed in the apartment. Eaton bashed open the door with his scizore after Alisha refused to open the door, but fortunately Zorro had made his escape by then. Eaton did a precursory glance and didn’t see anybody in the apartment, so he left quickly.\nDuring the final round of questioning, Eaton told you that something was happening about five blocks clockwise that he was needed at and the task force decided to accompany him to see what was happening.\nEaton and the rest of the task force show up just before the pinnacle of the protest. Oisin casts fly on himself and goes to get ramen. Rokkaku and the staff are very nervous about this, so or Oisin thinks (in reality they were ready for a fight) when the rocks start flying and the Bastion of the Sky sweeps in to arrest as many people as possible. Their forces are directed by somebody that the task force as not meant before wearing very shiny full plate armor. Wil helps defend the ramen shop, so Rokkaku tells him that he can eat for free from on now.\n","wordCount":"559","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-03-27T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-03-27T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Matt Schwennesen"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/session-recaps/session-log-2022-03-27/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Great Basin","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/ accesskey=h title="The Great Basin (Alt + H)">The Great Basin</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/docs/ title=Documents><span>Documents</span></a></li><li><a href=https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/stats/ title="Stat Blocks"><span>Stat Blocks</span></a></li><li><a href=https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/session-recaps/ title="Session Logs"><span>Session Logs</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/session-recaps/>Session Logs</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Session Log 27 March 2022</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-03-27 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>March 27, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;3 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;Matt Schwennesen&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/tree/exampleSite/content/session-recaps/session-log-2022-03-27.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p>When we last ventured to the Great Basin&mldr;</p><p>The date was 5 Fireharvest 1763 and the task force was gearing up to execute the warrant they have against Alisha&rsquo;s Herbal Remedies and Tattoo Parlor.
