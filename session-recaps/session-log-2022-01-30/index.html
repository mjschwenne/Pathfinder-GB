During a trip to the library to get the materials needed for a conspiracy board, Oisin and Will encountered Julius Peperthorn, Oisin’s Antiquarian. He seemed to think that Oisin was lucky for not getting expelled from the library and did drop some information about the missing Sword of Divinity, which apparently has connections to holy fire and that several people have tried to steal it in the past but where disintegrated in a burst of holy flames.\nBase at home base, the task force started to piece together what they knew and what questions they needed answered. They discussed\nA possible connection between the Glove of Bony Power and the ability to pull the sword from the rock. The use of the explosion as an entry or exit point People that needed to be investigated, including The formal attendees from the Founder’s Gala. The on-duty security guards. The catering and service people, such as the crew from the Blue Crow. The next day, 2 Fireharvest 1763, Breagan wakes early to try and find anything that the original investigative party missed at the scene of the crime. Arriving just before the construction crew started work, Breagan was not able to find any undiscovered tracks or clues. Meanwhile, Oisin used the spell Alter Self to assume the form of whomever left blood on the Gold Coin of the Crown that was found at the explosion site. The change was subtle, he grew a bit taller and older with longer hair but generally did not change in any measurable way. Oisin recognized this form is Ydin, the King of Ændor when it came under the control of the Empire of Xylte. He told the party that Ydin was killed on the floor of the Forum chamber on 10 Darknight 1623. Soon after, Dr. Luna left for the library to investigate the green paste. She talked with a 2 key curator named Bazyli Marchewka who seemed knowledgeable about explosives but a bit scatterbrained as she would frequently leave Dr. Luna to go fetch something from elsewhere in the library. During the day Zorro stopped by the library and requested that they prepare records from the last 200 years of Forum Delegates for his review which they stated would be ready the next day, (3 Fireharvest 1763). The rest of the party split into teams of two to inquire into the governments which did not assign members to the task force.\nRedfern and Will schedule an appointment with Silvius Albina of the Empire of Xylte for the next day at 3:30p for 30 minutes. Breagan and Oisin talk to Ikoma from the Niven Imperium and she tells them that the Imperium is launching its own investigation since it has people with “specific talents” that are not represented in the current task force and that they believe that the investigation will proceed smoother without the red tape associated with the Forum. Will and Zorro talked with Lord Cantort of the Atreides Duchy who tells them that the Atreides have a strong reputation of neutrality and that he suspects that whatever the task force find will be very controversial and require delicate handling so in order to better position the Duchy politically they cannot be involved in how those reports are generated. Oisin and Breagan attempted to visit the delegates from the Principality of Vi but found themselves in the tower of the Commune of Atrxous instead. They briefly talked to the delegate there and Leopold, a Tangus, offered them some sandwiches he had made earlier and encouraged them to stop by anytime. Correctly locating the tower of the Principality, Oisin and Breagan where then able to score a conference with both of the delegates, Bur Harcosa and Vessimur Yutros. The delegates seemed perhaps like there were in some form of disagreement and were not overly concerned with the members of the task force, but they did introduce the assigned member to the task force from the Principality, Jusa Lok. Jusa is a human woman and member of the Church of Kroina, Lady Foresight. During the meeting she seemed nervous and stressed, leading to an awkward exchange with Oisin about killing each other. Later, during the talk back she mentioned having a vision of her own death.\n","wordCount":"740","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-01-30T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-01-30T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Matt Schwennesen"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/session-recaps/session-log-2022-01-30/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Great Basin","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/ accesskey=h title="The Great Basin (Alt + H)">The Great Basin</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/docs/ title=Documents><span>Documents</span></a></li><li><a href=https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/stats/ title="Stat Blocks"><span>Stat Blocks</span></a></li><li><a href=https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/session-recaps/ title="Session Logs"><span>Session Logs</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/session-recaps/>Session Logs</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Session Log 30 January 2022</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-01-30 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>January 30, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;Matt Schwennesen&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/tree/exampleSite/content/session-recaps/session-log-2022-01-30.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p>When we last ventured to the Great Basin, the members of the task force were trying to get their grips on the clues left at the scene of the explosion.
