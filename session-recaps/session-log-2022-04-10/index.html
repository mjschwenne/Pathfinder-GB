Talking to Nessa Preston, captain of the Trobreryn guard, she told you that the guard was investigating the Keburipemi Syndicate and the tip had been given by an undercover guard named Arwyn Treharne, who is now missing. She seemed concerned that the task force’s plan involved them buying drugs, but did let them leave.\nSpeaking of the task force’s plan to track down the people who filled the warehouse with drugs, Oisin was convinced that in order for the humans of the party to play the role of a drug addict in need of another fix, they would need to become addicted to the ever growing collection of drugs that the task force was acquired. Eventually, the rest of the task force talked Oisin down, I think. He visited a magic item stock which had better inventory then most of the shops on Kerkrad, at least the ones that Oisin frequents. Maelor, the proprietor of the Arcane Gateway, seemed very friendly and the connection paid off later when Oisin took Wil there to pay a hat of disguise since he cannot be stopped by certain political enemies of his father Faolan Ragnory. Sadly the Grey Gambler’s Hat was just too expensive.\nWaiting until it is dark, Wil took you to an underground fight ring called the Hidden Fist. Everybody paid the 1 gp entry fee except Oisin and Jusa Lok. Wil lead them to a man named Dewey Parcell who would have the goods. He sold Redfern a bottle of Dwarven Fire Ale for 50 gp which he did not drink. Oisin’s moth traced him to what seemed to be an abandoned building directly behind the burned husk of the warehouse. Entering through the melted second story windows, and continuing one of my personally favorite things to do in these game; finding alternative ways in to structures, the task force found an deserted second floor with beat up furniture and debris around. Moving down stairs, you quickly realized that there was a lot of unaccounted for space since the staircase dead ended at the door leading to outside. Oisin found a sliding panel which revealed an unfinished first story with a loose gravel or dirt floor. Walking around to the other side of the room, you found some stairs leading down.\nFollowing them, you traced them to a small room with two chairs at a low table and their was an offshoot leading to what you believe is the warehouse, however that end of the tunnel has collapsed. Continuing inward, you found a small store room where Zorro opened one of the creates to find a bong. After investigating a small closet, your attention was turned to another door which you could occasionally hear guards on the other side of. Moving quickly, you headed down a corridor to your left and into a cramped bathroom, well a cramped pit toilet. Hi-jinx ensued when a pair of guards which Wil needed to see to use his hat of disguise to imitative spotted him through the cracked door. Oisin used mage hand to sling some shit around and pretend to be very ill and the guards left. Wil disguised himself as one of the guards and did a lap of the base. He reported that there was a main room which seemed to be a barrack, three other unexplored door and a pair of double doors craved with a Niven character.\nSneaking in the other direction, the task force entered the armory which had two people in it cleaning weapons. The two groups exchanged awkward glances when unexpectedly another figure appeared in between the two. They spoke in a low tone speaking Niven to the other two, who quickly left through a hidden exit in the bad of one of the lockers.\n","wordCount":"662","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Matt Schwennesen"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/session-recaps/session-log-2022-04-10/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Great Basin","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/ accesskey=h title="The Great Basin (Alt + H)">The Great Basin</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/historicaldocs/ title="Historical Documents"><span>Historical Documents</span></a></li><li><a href=https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/stats/ title="Stat Blocks"><span>Stat Blocks</span></a></li><li><a href=https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/session-recaps/ title="Session Logs"><span>Session Logs</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/session-recaps/>Session Logs</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Session Log 10 April 2022</h1><div class=post-meta>4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;Matt Schwennesen&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/tree/exampleSite/content/session-recaps/session-log-2022-04-10.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p>When we last ventured to the Great Basin, the data was 20 Fireharvest 1763.</p><p>The members of the task force were investigating the destruction of a warehouse on the docks of Taerwyn.
