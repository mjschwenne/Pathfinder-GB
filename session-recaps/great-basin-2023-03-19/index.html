While preparing for this meeting, on the 26th, Wil learned that there had been an attack on the Ragnory Shipping Co headquarters which resulted in the Death of Foalan Ragnory. While distraught by the news, Wil was able to gather from Nessa Preston that the attack had one assailant with a glowing red katana. While Wil, not the sharpest tool in the shed, made several guesses about who the wearer of this blade is, he eventually agreed with Nessa that it was most likely Vicious, an undine whom you had first encountered during the Keburpemi Syndicate Evacuation of Taerwyn last month.\nUpset, Wil headed over to Rokkaku's Ramen to see if Niwa had any information about where to find Vicious given his past history with the syndicate. Ordering the rattlesnake ramen as instructed, Will requested all information that the syndicate had about Vicious' current whereabouts. The next day, as Oisin entered his apartment for the night, he was greeted by a Niven man wearing a long leather coat with a swooping haircut streaked with blue. Oisin, unsure what to do Oisin pretended to be a neighbor in need of some sugar before dropping the act to reveal that he was a tenant of the apartment. As it turns out, the man was send by Niwa in response to Wil's research for information about Vicious. When Wil got home a few minutes later, the man revealed that for a while, it appeared that Vicious was going to be a major playing resisting Niwa's claim to the leadership of the syndicate so he was heavily monitored and his associates interrogated. They learned that Vicious operates from a base on an island in Kratermeer. Supposedly, the island is always wreathed in fog and moves all over the lake. However, the last associate captured by the syndicate had a compass which leads to the island. He gave the compass to Will and tells him that the syndicate would strongly support any course of action which removes Vicious as a player in the criminal spheres.\nThe next day was the 28th, when the Forum meeting was taking place. Arriving early in the morning, you were prepared for several hours of deflecting and dodging to prevent knowledge about the source of Cylex, the potential location of buyers of the explosive and the criminal connections which had been the basis of much of your success so far. The opening volley was about the Caerwent Empire, an external threat that you had encounter in Roksduens who claimed that the Basin was soon to be conquered once more. It was a move which took the Forum members by surprise, and there was both eager to learn more and disappointed that the captured solider in the Roks's desert wasn't returned to Kerkard for more questioning. Eventually, however, the Forum realized that there was no more information to be had and returned to the actual matter at hand. You told the Forum about some progress made in tracking the explosive used in the thief, that it is called Cylex and that you had interrupted a potential Cylex sale. Some members of the Forum, namely Barno Henchor wanted you to reveal who was buying the explosive but you stood firm. The Forum also questioned trips to the Niven Lantern Festival and Roksduens and how they were related to the investigation. Barno Henchor even proposed that they limit the Task Force's access to Koncord resources like the teleportation network. After a passionate speech by Oisin, the vote was tallied. The resolution failed 8 - 12. However, Bur Harcosa insisted on more regular meetings between you and the Forum, specifically every two weeks. The next one will be 6 Withermire.\nWe now resume after the meeting as you prepare to leave Kerkard and hunt down Vicious, a known member of LAKE and the person who killed Wil's father.\n","wordCount":"695","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-03-19T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-03-19T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Matt Schwennesen"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/session-recaps/great-basin-2023-03-19/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Great Basin","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/ accesskey=h title="The Great Basin (Alt + H)">The Great Basin</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/docs/ title=Documents><span>Documents</span></a></li><li><a href=https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/stats/ title="Stat Blocks"><span>Stat Blocks</span></a></li><li><a href=https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/session-recaps/ title="Session Logs"><span>Session Logs</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/session-recaps/>Session Logs</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Great Basin Session (2023-03-19)</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-03-19 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>March 19, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;Matt Schwennesen&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/tree/exampleSite/content/session-recaps/great-basin-2023-03-19.org rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><div id=outline-container-headline-1 class=outline-2><h2 id=headline-1>Session Recapitulation</h2><div id=outline-text-headline-1 class=outline-text-2><p>When we last ventured to the Great Basin…</p><p>The Task Force, while recovering from the party in Galimatias where Breagan
