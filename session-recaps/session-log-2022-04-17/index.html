Upon entering the armory, they realized that they were not alone: two other members of the syndicate were polishing weapons. The two groups exchanged a few awkward glances when a figure that you were sure wasn’t their before suddenly appeared. The mysterious figure told the other syndicate members something in Niven and they quickly left the room. While talking to the figure, you learned many things. Her name is Niwa and she seems to be an assassin for the syndicate. Within the city of Taerwyn, the leaders of syndicate operations are a pair of former pirates called Vicious and Voracious, who is Vicious’s ankle-biter. Niwa is interested in making Vicious look bad in front of the higher ups in the syndicate and wanted the help of the task force in this endeavor since the local Trobreryn investigative force is not moving fast enough for her. In exchange, she offers information and reveals several things to prove her intent. Namely, the green explosive used in the bombing of the Forum is called cylex and was created in a military research lab in the Niven Imperium before the Keburipemi Syndicate kidnapped the lead researchers and hijacked a load of the explosive.\nVicious plans to evacuate all of the personal and equipment from the city until the investigation blows over, taking a small boat down Drainage Channel E. Talking to Nessa Preston and the rest of the Trobreryn guard, you strike a deal: for the information about the syndicate’s plans and assistance in the operation to stop them, the Trobreryn guard will give the task force half of the value on the boat if it is captured.\nOn the night of the operation, the channel is dammed with several thick logs, and the personnel stationed 150 feet before the dam. Quitely, the keelboat rows into view, manned by eight rowers, captained by Vicious and Voracious. When the task force engages them, more members of the Keburpemi Syndicate who were travelling parallel to the boat strike from the shadows. The winner of this battle remain to be seen.\n","wordCount":"371","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-04-17T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-04-17T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Matt Schwennesen"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/session-recaps/session-log-2022-04-17/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Great Basin","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/ accesskey=h title="The Great Basin (Alt + H)">The Great Basin</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/docs/ title=Documents><span>Documents</span></a></li><li><a href=https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/stats/ title="Stat Blocks"><span>Stat Blocks</span></a></li><li><a href=https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/session-recaps/ title="Session Logs"><span>Session Logs</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/session-recaps/>Session Logs</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Session Log 17 April 2022</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-04-17 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>April 17, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;2 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;Matt Schwennesen&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/tree/exampleSite/content/session-recaps/session-log-2022-04-17.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p>When we last ventured to the Great Basin&mldr;</p><p>It 20 Fireharvest 1763 and the members of the Task Force had infiltrated a hideout of the Keburipemi Syndicate.
