Jusa, while blinded and entangled in obsidian, functioning as life support for most of the Task Force with penalty of channel positive energy discharges. The enemy sage casting Wall of Fire, encircling all of the still bound task force members. Meru dispelling the Wall of Fire the round before it would have killed Redfern. A last ditch attempt by the remaining sage to cast an Apocalyptic Fireball. Eventually, you prevailed through strong teamwork and supporting one another.
