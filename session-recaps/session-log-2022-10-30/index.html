At this point, he started violently choking and an aura of dread quickly permeated the cell as everybody backed away from Voracious. Even Jusa did not want to approach Voracious as he collapsed on the floor, claiming that this amount of damage was beyond her capabilities. Using Greater Detect Magic, Zorro was able to learn that this effect gave off a Strong aura and was able to identify the caster's residuals in the spell's energy. Working with Jusa, they deduced that this wasn't so much a spell, which implies some control of the energy, as it was channeling massive amounts of raw negative energy into Voracious.\nWhen security was called, the task force was taken into a holding room until Eaton appeared to question them.
