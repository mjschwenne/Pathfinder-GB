In reality, it was Niwa disguised as the Adobaizā. The Niven government wants to keep a closer eye on you, which is difficult considering the amount of borders you regularly cross. Their solution is to appoint a member to the Task Force directly who will be able to report anything suspicious back to them. Niwa also explained that she does not have the political power to select who the new member would be, but does have enough to nominate somebody for consideration.\nAfter a brief debate, you decided that Meru should be nominated for the position. Niwa also mentioned that if you need to get in contact with her in the future, visit Rokkaku's Ramen on Kerkrad and order the Rattlesnake Ramen.\nWent the Task Force tried to teleport back to Kerkard, you were detained momentarily by Niven Castle Guards and talked to both the Koncord representatives and the Adobaizā, who was confused by your story of her teleporting you all into the middle of the wilderness. However, she admitted that the current political situation in the Basin meant that she could not detain you without drawing the ire of the rest of the nations.\nThe next day, Meru was 'sworn in' as the official Niven representative on the Task Force. While showing them to the workspace you had been appointed, the Truthspeaker Steven was delivering the news. He told you that\nArendelle had only harvested 76% of their expected yield and were investigating the cause and what can be done about it. The Kerkard Union of Dock Workers was disavowing a spike in sabotage occuring at the docks. A manhunt was still ongoing on Kerkard after the disappearance of the Pendant of Izuka (a powerful relic from the Heralds) and Samuel Banciu, son of collector Ferdinand Banciu. The Bastion of the Sky has not commented on whether they thing Samuel stole the pendant but are \"considering all possibilities\". In the Empire of Xylte, the son of an Imperial Senator was found dead in what is believed to be 13th murder by a pro-Andorr assassin. This one is notable because it was the first non-military target. Several days ago, in Roksduens, a massive raiding party wiped out Calchiroos Tribe by razing their central city. Preliminary reports mentioned a figure wearing refined metal armor and with a sword and shield, the first time such a figure has been reported with a raiding party. The shield had a hammer and laurels engraved on it. Later, during several days of crafting and downtime, you also learned that\nAfter news of the destruction in Roksduens, the Eichen Kingdom has announced that it will increase the upper age limit for conscription into it's armed forces to 30 and plans to grow the total number of active duty soldiers by 50,000 across all divisions of its armed forces. The Empire of Xylte will be imposing a curfew in all major cities from 10p - 6a in response to the \"threats from abroad and within\" which will allow their guard to prepare to defense the glory of the Empire. Sources in the Niven Imperium are reporting a massive increase in the number of gang fights and infighting within the Keburipemi Syndicate over the last few days. Rumors are that the leadership was recently overthrown, but there are no clues as to who the new leaders are. On the 15th of Shimmerfall and the Task Force set out for Tomo, the 'capital' (if you could call it that) of the Tomo tribe of Roksduens and the nation as a whole. You teleported to a circle in the middle of a henge, no civilization in site except a dirt path. Following the path across a mostly barren scrubland for several hours lead to a medium sized town composed primarily of ramshackle wooden huts and tents. The settlement looked like it was originally a nomadic group that simply stopped moving many years ago.\nWe now resume in the town square, when an eidolon duel between a horse-like creature with many horns fights a large bear-creature with multicolored fur. A large crowd has gathered to watch.\n","wordCount":"782","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-02-05T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-02-05T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Matt Schwennesen"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/session-recaps/great-basin-2023-02-05/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Great Basin","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/ accesskey=h title="The Great Basin (Alt + H)">The Great Basin</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/docs/ title=Documents><span>Documents</span></a></li><li><a href=https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/stats/ title="Stat Blocks"><span>Stat Blocks</span></a></li><li><a href=https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/session-recaps/ title="Session Logs"><span>Session Logs</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/session-recaps/>Session Logs</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Great Basin Session (2023-02-05)</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-02-05 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>February 5, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;Matt Schwennesen&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/tree/exampleSite/content/session-recaps/great-basin-2023-02-05.org rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><div id=outline-container-headline-1 class=outline-2><h2 id=headline-1>Session Recapitulation</h2><div id=outline-text-headline-1 class=outline-text-2><p>When we last ventured to the Great Basin…</p><p>The Task Force was recovering from slaying Keburipemi with Niwa in a syndicate
