When asked if you would like to rest, you decided to push forward.\nEventually the party encountered a large gate marking the treeline on a trek up a mountain. As you approached, the spectral form of a suite of armor materialized and challenged you. It claimed that your reason for climbing the mountain was to upset the balance of nature and \"was not a just cause\". After a brief conversation which quickly stalled, Niwa signaled to Oisin that it was time to take out the armor and pass by force.\nThe fight that ensued was not a typical combat. Because the you had elected not to rest before climbing the mountain, the spellcasters were critically low on spells and everybody was low on consumable class resources. The fighting was tough, the spectral armor aided by two statues flanking the gate. Notable moments in the fight included:\nRedfern summoning a giant scorpion and it immediately getting killed by the armor. Oisin creating the illusion of a solid rock wall filling the gate and creating a barrier to pass though. Breagan refusing to fight, instead just maneuvering to the other side of the illusionary wall and waiting for the rest of the task force to cross through. After the fight, everybody was eager to rest. Moving about an hour past the gate, a suitable camp site was selected. During the first watch shift, a new figure approached, accosting Wil with a simple and poignant \"Hello Wil\". They were wearing a cloak of vibrant, glowing constellations over traditional Niven gear and levitating a few inches above the ground. They also carried an empty katana scabbard and a large farmer's hat. Introducing themselves as Meru, they explained that they had seem the faces of the Task Force and this location written in the stars and decided to come assist in their goal of upsetting the leadership of the Keburipemi Syndicate. After some tense discussions with Niwa and the rest of the Task Force, it was decided that Meru would join them for at least this mission.\nThe next morning, with everybody rested, you set out again with a clearer idea of your mission. Niwa had explained overnight that Keburipemi was chained in the caldera of an active volcano which had a monastery designed to guard the imprisoned god. She was unsure if the monastery had been compromised by the sinister influence of Keburipemi, but even if it wasn't the monks would not allow outsiders to see the deity so heavy resistance should be expected. During this time, Breagan learned for the first time about the mission and while everybody thought she was going to oppose it, she actually approved of slaying one of the most evil and active deities in the Niven Imperium. We resume with all of you assembled outside the massive, heavy brass doors of a large monastery which is slightly recessed into the mountain.\n","wordCount":"532","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-04T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-04T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Matt Schwennesen"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/session-recaps/session-log-2022-12-04/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The Great Basin","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/ accesskey=h title="The Great Basin (Alt + H)">The Great Basin</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/docs/ title=Documents><span>Documents</span></a></li><li><a href=https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/stats/ title="Stat Blocks"><span>Stat Blocks</span></a></li><li><a href=https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/session-recaps/ title="Session Logs"><span>Session Logs</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://mjschwenne.github.io/Pathfinder-GB/session-recaps/>Session Logs</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Session Log (2022-12-04)</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-04 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 4, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;3 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;Matt Schwennesen&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/tree/exampleSite/content/session-recaps/session-log-2022-12-04.org rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><div id=outline-container-headline-1 class=outline-2><h2 id=headline-1>Session Recap</h2><div id=outline-text-headline-1 class=outline-text-2><p>When we last ventured to the Great Basin,</p><p>It still the 10th of Shimmerfall.
